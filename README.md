Notes:

1. I used double quotes in this project to get a feel for whether I liked them more than double quotes. Currently undecided.
2. I am not as comfortable with arrow functions - but used them here to follow along with the instructor.
3. Local storage is not secure and is used for demo purposes only.
4. Any question or answer that has quotes or an apostrophe is not displaying correctly - need to add json.replace().
5. The loader does not currently show up as the questions load quickly. Will set timeout to show loader for a few seconds.
6. I would like to display the correct answer if the wrong answer is selected.
